Angular - Week 6
Assignment - Ninja Gold with Angular Services
For this assignment utilize your knowledge of event handlers, angular components, and services.

Your AppComponent should be the parent to two other components. The AppComponent should provide building data to one of the other components. That component should use this provided data to create the building forms.

Have the “app.component.html” display the gold count and other components.

Use the second component more than once. Each building form should be it’s own variation of the second component.

The third component should display the logged data.

Remember, your service should be the main hub for data manipulation and storage.

# NinjaGold

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
