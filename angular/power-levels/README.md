Week 5 - Angular
Assignment - Power Levels
Create an app which a user can input a power level value between 1-100 in the input tag. Present the user 6 sections that use the power level value, multiply it by a specific multiplier and display the adjusted value.
    Levels --> *1, *10, *90, *150, *250, *500
    Show a text phrase based on power level (>9k = Over 9k; >20k = Superlative; =50k = The One)

# PowerLevels

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
