Week 6 - Angular
Assignment - Numbers with Services
Create an Angular app that has 3 components that work with 1 service.

Two of the components should use service methods to generate and store random numbers. Letâ€™s call these components Alpha and Beta. Each component's number list should be displayed near their button in their respective template (HTML) files.

When the third component button is clicked, sum all the values stored in the service generated from clicking Alpha components button and then subtract from that the sum of all the values generated from clicking the button in the Beta component. Store this number in the service and display it near the third components button.

# AngularServiceApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
