Assignment - Dojo Weather Forecast
Create an app which presents the user with 6 different views (using the router-outlet) each different url/view should present the user with a Dojo city. Within each of these views, present the user with the current weather information. Additionally, show an image of each of the cities. Use the following URL pattern for each city:
    Default (root) url - 'http://localhost:4200/' should immediately redirect us to your local Dojo url (Wilmington, NC). 
    Seattle, WA - 'http://localhost:4200/seattle'
    San Jose, CA - 'http://localhost:4200/sanjose'
    Burbank, CA - 'http://localhost:4200/burbank'
    Dallas, TX - 'http://localhost:4200/dallas'
    Washington D.C. - 'http://localhost:4200/dc'
    Chicago, IL - 'http://localhost:4200/chicago'
