Week 7 - Full MEAN
Assignment - Anonymous Notes
Build an application as a full MEAN project. With this application, we allow any user to come to our website and add a note. We also want all notes to be displayed under the 'new note' form, with the most recent notes at the top of the list. Use Mongo DB to store all notes. Update page dynamically as new notes are added. Each note should include content & date it was created (format Jan 1, 2017 6:11:58AM). Note should be a minimum of 3 characters.

# Notes

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
